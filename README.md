# Data-Cleaning-EDA-using-SQL
In this project we analyse a dataset we got from 'Real World Fake Data'  I picked the call-center  
using SQL then we visualize it using PowerBI.    

Steps we did :
- Download the csv file.
- Import the file to MySQL
- Clean it a bit (since it's pretty clean to start with)
- Perform EDA
- Visualize it using PowerBI.
